Shopping List App Development Plan

Project Overview:
Develop a shopping list application where users can manage shopping items. The app will allow users to:
- Add new items to the shopping list
- Edit the quantity or name of existing items
- Delete items
- Mark items as purchased
- Persist shopping list data across app sessions using local storage
- Use Redux Toolkit to manage the application state

---

Feature Breakdown:

1. Redux Setup
- Objective: Set up Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the shopping list.
- Tasks:
  - Install Redux Toolkit.
  - Set up shoppingListSlice.js with reducers and actions for CRUD operations (add, edit, delete, toggle purchased).
  - Set up the Redux store and connect it to the app.

2. Shopping List Functionality (CRUD)
- Objective: Implement the functionality to manage the shopping list.
- Tasks:
  - Display List: Create functionality to display a list of shopping items.
  - Add Item: Implement an input field and a button for adding items to the list.
  - Edit Item: Implement functionality to edit an item's name or quantity.
  - Delete Item: Implement functionality to delete an item from the list.
  - Toggle Purchased: Add a feature to mark items as purchased.

3. Persistence with AsyncStorage
- Objective: Persist the shopping list data using AsyncStorage.
- Tasks:
  - Implement functions to save and load the shopping list data from AsyncStorage.
  - Ensure the shopping list is loaded when the app is reopened.
  - Update AsyncStorage every time an item is added, edited, deleted, or marked as purchased.

4. User Feedback
- Objective: Provide basic visual feedback for CRUD operations.
- Tasks:
  - Display success messages when an item is added, edited, or deleted.
  - Display error messages when there are issues (e.g., invalid input).

5. UI/UX Design
- Objective: Create a basic UI layout for managing the shopping list.
- Tasks:
  - Basic UI Structure: Create input fields for adding/editing items, checkboxes for marking items as purchased, and buttons for CRUD operations.
  - UI Enhancements: Improve UI later with better styling (e.g., buttons, input fields).
  - Ensure UI is simple and functional before adding advanced styles.

6. Accessibility (Optional)
- Objective: Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities.
- Tasks:
  - Add accessibility labels and aria attributes to input fields, buttons, and other important elements.
  - Ensure the app is usable with screen readers.

7. Testing
- Objective: Test all features and Redux integration.
- Tasks:
  - Test CRUD functionality (add, edit, delete, mark as purchased).
  - Test AsyncStorage persistence to ensure data is saved and loaded correctly.
  - Test Redux actions and reducers to ensure they work correctly.
  - Test UI for responsiveness and basic interaction.

8. Documentation
- Objective: Provide documentation for both developers and users.
- Tasks:
  - Developer Documentation: Include setup instructions and any important notes on running the app.
  - User Guide: Create a user guide explaining how to use the shopping list app (add, edit, delete, etc.).

Development Process:

1. Set Up Redux and Basic State Management
- Initialize Redux in the app and set up the store.
- Define the shopping list slice with reducers and actions (add, edit, delete, toggle purchased).

2. Implement Core Functionality
- Implement functions to add, edit, delete, and toggle items.
- Connect these functions to the UI (later).

3. Add Persistence Using AsyncStorage
- Create functions to save and load the shopping list to/from AsyncStorage.
- Ensure data is loaded when the app starts and saved after each modification.

4. Build the UI
- Create input fields for adding new items and editing existing items.
- Display a list of items with checkboxes to mark items as purchased.
- Add buttons for CRUD operations.

5. User Feedback and Error Handling
- Provide success messages for add/edit/delete actions.
- Show error messages for invalid actions (e.g., missing input).

6. Improve UI Styling (Later)
- Add styling to make the UI more user-friendly and visually appealing.
- Ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.

7. Testing and Debugging
- Thoroughly test CRUD functionality, AsyncStorage persistence, and Redux actions/reducers.
- Fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.

8. Final Documentation
- Document the setup process for developers.
- Write a guide for users on how to use the shopping list app.
